# This is Heart Disease Prediction Project

## we are going to predict based on the data whether someone has heart disease or not

1- Problem Defination
2- Data
3- Evaluate
4- Feature
5- Modelling
6- Experimentations
Step 1 : Problem Defination

Based on the given Data we need to predict if a patient has Heart Disease or not

Step 2 : Data

We have data and have loaded it already

Step 3 : Evaluate

In initial stages we need to make sure, if our model gives us the accuracy of 95%

Step 4 : Feature

What features are important , what features columns means what

1 Age: age of the patient [years]
2 Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
3 ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
4 RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
5 Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
6 FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
7 RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
8 MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
9 ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
10 Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
11 ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
12 HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
